<h1>The Project Overview</h1>
In this scenario, I was given a task to develop a web for an NGO. <b>Everyone Can Get Rich</b>  is a non-governmental charity organization. This NGO works to improve the financial literacy of the common people. The app here developed is titled <b>Simple Interest Calculator</b>, which will compute the interest one can earn given the amount you wish to save, the number of years you can keep it with the bank and the interest rate the bank would pay.

The NGO is very particular about the way the app looks including the colors and the alignment of the form elements.
